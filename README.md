# Planet Genrator | A world building tool

this software goal, is to allow the user an easy way to 
generate the surface of planets based upon multiple parameters
such as :
 - 1 : average temperature
 - 2 : elevation of the water
 - 3 : average precipitation
 - 4 : raduis of the planet
and many other.

The resulting output will be pixel art image of the planet
with a mercator like layout, featuring the various information 
of the planet for example :
 - 1 : elevation map
 - 2 : biome map
 - 3 : temperature map
 - 4 : water map
 - 5 : geopolitical map ( blank to be manualy modified )

The user can also make a geopolitical map with tool allowing 
him to give certain border to the planet, actually only colors 
will be allowed.
in the end the images generated will be given to the user in
a png format.
